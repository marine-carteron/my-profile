			<h3> Who am I? </h3>
			<center><img src="images/family.png" alt="Me and family" class="photo-shadow"></center>
			<p> My nyme is Marine Carteron, I'm a 19-years-old girl who entered HEC Paris this year. I have lived with my parents and my 2 little brothers in Levallois-Perret since I was born. I have studied in Levallois, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris. </p>
			<p> I will leave my hometown next year for a 6-month exchange in Seoul (South Korea).</p>

			<h3> My hobbies </h3>
			<p> When I was in middle-school I started to <strong>code some websites</strong> on a Internet platform called "Webidev". I created lots of game websites such as a cat-dressing one or some MMORPG games. They are sadly no more available today because the platform closed, but this hobby explains why I decided to take up this MOOC. </p>

			<p> I also like <strong> sports </strong>: I am part of the HEC rugby team "FHR" but I also do tennis and sailing during the summer. What I prefer in sport is taking part to an activity with my friends and feeling strong emotions with them. </p>

			<h3> My dreams </h3>
			My oldest dream is to have a happy family with a job I like. But more specifically, I would like to:
			<ul>
				<li> Develop my writing skills by writing a book or writing articles for an international institution such as the FMI or the OECD. In fact, I am a big fan of the notes published by this institution about macroeconomics indicators. I hope I would have the opportunity to do an internship in one of these institutions. </li>
				<li> Win the BDE campaign which began one week ago. I'm part of the leaders of the "Baiguini List" and I think we really deserve to win and become HEC's future BDE.</li>
				<li> Paragliding above mountains as the heroes of "Intouchables" do in the film. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3> My skills </h3>
			<center><img src="images/sailing1.png" alt="Sailing and Driving" class="photo-shadow"></center>
			<p> As I said before, I know <strong> how to code in a basic language </strong> which was only available on the Webidev platform. I also learnt design by myself and I know how to use Photofiltre and Gimp. </p>
			<p> I also have skills in sailing, tennis, dance and swimming. </p>
			<p> I also have my driving licence and expect to have my <strong>boating licence</strong> soon. </p>
